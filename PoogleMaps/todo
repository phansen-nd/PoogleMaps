Notes:
-Add Screen is currently transformed via frame, not constraint, may need to drag a constraint to an outlet and do it that way
-Shrink Add screen or add more details
-Enable add button once both (required) fields are populated
-Make check box create a spot on the map and upload to Parse

To do:
-Suggest nearby locations when user opens app
    -Like those signposts that have signs pointing to Sydney, Whistler, Pacific, Maine, etc.
-Slide up add VC when keyboard pops up (from Stack Overflow?)


To done:
