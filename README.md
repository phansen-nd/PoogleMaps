# Poogle Maps

*Improving the Experience of Using a Public Restroom*

Even the best boy scouts can be caught off guard sometimes when nature calls. Imagine you’re in a new city, making your way to an interview or seeing the sights when suddenly, the burrito you had for breakfast makes clear intentions that it’s ready to exit your body. It’s imperative to remain cool and collected to avoid public embarrassment - it’s time to take out Poogle Maps and locate the nearest public restroom that promises a neat, pleasant experience. Poogle Maps will show you all of the tagged public restrooms around you (Starbucks, City Hall, metro station, etc.) accompanied by a picture and reviews from frequent users, so you can make an educated decision about how to best relieve yourself. Next time you find yourself downstream, make sure you have your paddle, Poogle Maps, on hand to navigate tricky situations.
## Features
* Firebase backend - real-time data synchronization that stores user info, custom objects, and photos remotely.
* GoogleMaps API - built on the GoogleMaps framework with custom InfoWindows, custom marker behavior, and custom buttons that adhere to GoogleMaps design standards.
* Fluid UI - intuitive gestures and actions to facilitate easy navigation through the app.
* Useful rating system - tells users what they want to know about bathrooms.

## Tools
* Create Poogles, custom objects that store location data, photos, testimonials, and user info about a bathroom experience.
* Testimonials are a way for other users to offer feedback on Poogles. Rate a bathroom on:
 * Cleanliness
 * Spaciousness
 * Seclusion
 * Convenience
* Sign up with email address and create a username
* Limit your search to the area around you, from college campuses to metropolitan areas

## Future Work

There is a lot of room to grow with Poogle Maps, from a sleeker UI to a more intuitive app flow. Specifically, there are a few new directions I would love to explore:
* In-bathroom experience - mini games in-app?
* User loyalty - gain credit for frequenting certain bathrooms?
* Public Poogle verification - no manual content checking
